# Code-Quiz

## Description

This was the fourth challenge issued to me by the Wash U Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a coding quiz game that would have a timer, take time off for wrong answers, and be able to save high scores. This was an even numbered challenge, so we were given no starter code and everything was done from scratch

I learned of lot about working with Javascript while working on this assignment, such as use of event listeners, and the importance of removing said event listeners when their job is done. There was a lot of trial and error during the development that pushed me to think different and tackle the various issues I was dealing with with different approaches; issues such as the points for right and wrong answers not adding up properly, due to the event listeners still existing from previous questions, or having issues getting the timer display to update to reflect the loss of time when a question is answered incorrectly. I also got to get some more practice in working on the html and css from scratch for a page.
